To compile LCARS with the old API, you need a driver-dir with the old
drivers in path <driversdir> and use the configure-command:

./configure  --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --host=powerpc-tuxbox-linux-gnu --prefix=<prefix> --with-driver=<driversdir> --with-dvbincludes=<driversdir>/include --with-target=cdk --enable-maintainer-mode

If you want the old vbi as well, you have to add -DOLD_API in
src/Makefile.am to the INCLUDES-line.

If you want to compile a version, that runs on dreamboxes, user the -DDREAMBOX flag
in src/Makefile.am.

Have fun.
