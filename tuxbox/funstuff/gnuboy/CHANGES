disabled surface locking calls for now
properly initialize default path on DOS

backed out hack for Altered Space and W&W because it broke other games
new code to make them work, hopefully this time it's right
now we give an error on unknown rom/ram size to prevent crashing
integrated Windows port by mewse

began work on optimizing memory io in the C code
updated HACKING slightly

optimized instruction emulation accordingly
a few optimizations to the outer asm cpu loop

explicit link of SDL target with -lpthread, tell me if this causes problems

added Damian to the CREDITS file

workaround for undocumented 512 byte ram size, won't necessarily work
changes in saved state format
slight improvements to asm cpu core
