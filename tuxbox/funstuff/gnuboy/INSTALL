GNUBOY INSTALLATION


  *NIX SYSTEMS

The easiest way to build gnuboy for *nix is with the configure script:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

GNU make should no longer be required to build, but it can't hurt.

By default, heavy optimization and asm cpu and graphics cores will be
used if available on your platform. For information on compiletime
options related to performance and debugging, type:

  ./configure --help

Alternatively, if you don't like the GNU configure script, you may
copy the Makefile.nix to Makefile and edit it by hand to work with
your system. Make sure you uncomment -DIS_LITTLE_ENDIAN if your cpu is
little endian, and sgnuboy if you want the svgalib target to be built.
You're on your own picking compiler flags for optimization if you do
it this way.

Running make should produce the binaries xgnuboy, fbgnuboy, sgnuboy
and/or sdlgnuboy, depending on the availability of the various
interface libraries on your host.  The install target will install
these to $(prefix)/bin, where prefix is specified to configure in the
usual way. The default prefix is of course /usr/local/.


  WINDOWS

If you want it, port it. See HACKING for help.


  DOS

You'll need djgpp to use the included Makefile. Theoretically it
shouldn't be hard to port the dos-specific modules to work with other
compilers, but I see no reason why it should be necessary.

Since all DOS systems are basically alike, just copy Makefile.dos to
Makefile and type "make" to compile gnuboy. No configuration should be
necessary. If you do have build problems, let us know.

After compiling, place gnuboy.exe wherever you want.

Binaries are also available for DOS; check the site from which you
obtained gnuboy to see if it provides copies.
