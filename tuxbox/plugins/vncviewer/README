This is a vnc plugin for the tuxbox project by Zwen (Zwen@tuxbox.org)
It is based on fbvnc - a framebuffer-based VNC client, 
see http://pocketworkstation.org/fbvnc.html
Also includes code from the unix vnc port , 
see  http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/

Lots to do still, but basic functionality is working.
Code is very messy, that's the way I found it ;-)

Keys:
===============
home : quit plugin
ok : left mouse click
setup (dbox/dream): toggle 16:9 mode
? : mouse up/ mouse down toggle (e.g. for moving windows)
mute: toggle mouse movement/panning mode
up/down/left/right: move pointer/pan screen
vol_down: scale++ (zoom out)
vol_up: scale-- (zoom in)
red: left mouse double click
green: mouse middle click
yellow: mouse right click
blue: toggle virtual keyboard

Configfile (CONFIGDIR + vnc.conf) syntax
=========================================
n:= 0 - 9
server<n>=<vnc server>
port<n>=<vnc port> (i.e. 5900 for screen0 5901 for screen1 ...)
passwd<n>=<passwd> (only needed if not using using vncpasswd)
scale<n>=<scale factor> (1 no scale - 4 scale by 1/4)
server_scale<n>=<scale factor> (1 no scale.... / server must support this feature)
debug=<debug?> (turn on debugging -> 1)

ATTENTION: Unix style ! remove any CR

Authentication
=============================================
The secure way:
   generate a vncpasswd file on a unix machine tool 
   vncpasswd (not yet portet to dbox2)
   and copy it to CONFIGDIR/vncpasswd
   donot include the passwd parameter in vnc.conf file

The not so secure way:
   Put the passwd in cleartext in the vnc.conf file
   e.g. passwd=DISROCKS
