<h1>fbvnc - a framebuffer-based VNC client</h1>

<p>fbvnc is a framebuffer based viewer for the Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
protocol. It is designed for Linux-based handhelds, such as the Compaq iPAQ and
Sharp Zaurus, and controlled through the touch screen and hardware buttons. The
intended use is to connect this client to a background Xvnc process also
running on the handheld.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> This software is for Linux, it does <i>not</i> work on Windows CE.</p>

<p>It offers the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>virtual desktops larger than the physical display, using the touch
  screen to pan the visible area

<li>anti-aliased scaling (display a 640x480 desktop on a 320x240 display)

<li>integrated full-featured keyboard (including all editing and function
  keys), toggled on/off with a button - it is always available when you
  need it, and doesn't get in the way if you don't.

<li>supports three mouse buttons, and keyboard modified mouse events 
  (i.e. Ctrl-&lt;Mouse1&gt; for accessing the xterm menu)

<li>optional precise mouse button mode - the touch screen only moves the
  pointer, and clicking a button generates mouse events (useful for
  resizing windows and other cases where high accuracy is required)
</ul>

<p>And, of course, it offers the benefits of a VNC based solution - you can
access your handheld desktop simultaneously from your PC over a network connection,
or display a remote Linux or Windows desktop on the handheld. This is especially
useful when combined with a wireless network.</p>

<h1>Why a VNC client?</h1>

<p>You may be wondering if it makes sense to run a VNC client+server
on the handheld instead of the native X server. Obviously all the features
needed could also be integrated into the X server, but (since I am not
familiar with the innards of the X server), I found it much easier to add
them to the simple thin client for the VNC protocol. </p>

<p>IMHO, the keyboard (or in general, the main input method) should not be an
X client, because it is very hard to get the interaction between the user,
the input program, the window manager and the application working
smoothly. Those of you who have spent some time working with Xscribble
or xvkbd might agree ;-)  (I do not want to disparage the authors of any
of the programs involved - this is a fundamentally hard problem when
working within the context of an X client.)</p>

<p>The anti-aliased virtual desktop attempts to address the problem of the low
screen resolution. Patching X applications to use less screen real estate is
painful to impossible - and this way, many more programs are usable immediately
without any changes. For example, the "ace of penguins" game suite (available
from www.delorie.com) now works on the iPAQ unmodified, making the machine much
more useful :-)  And IMHO, a 10x20 font scaled down to 5x10 is much more
readable than an equivalently-sized non-antialiased font. (Note: fbvnc (and
this text) was written in October 2000, at that time anti-aliasing was not
yet available in the X server for the iPAQ.)</p>

<h1>Installing and running fbvnc</h1>

<p>If you just want the VNC client and already have a VNC server (i.e. on a
different machine on the network), you just need the 'fbvnc' <a
href='download/'>binary</a> for your architecture. Unzip it and put it in your
path somewhere, it does not depend on any other files except for the C
library. Run it from the command line and specify the server to connect to:</p>

<blockquote><tt>$ fbvnc 10.1.1.3:0</tt></blockquote>

<p>If you also want to run a VNC server on your handheld, you have several
options. Check out the <a href='download'><b>chroot-debian</b></a> package
(sorry, no web page yet) if you want a full Debian environment including X11,
or use Qtopia-X.

<h1>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<dl>

<dt><b>The touchscreen calibration is messed up</b>

<dd>Either press the "pan" button eight times to force recalibration ([Start]
on iPAQ, [Home] on Zaurus); or remove /etc/fbvnc-calibration.conf and restart
fbvnc. You can cancel calibration by pushing a button if you get there
accidentally.

<dt><b>fbvnc connects and asks for the password, then hangs</b>

<dd>fbvnc doesn't work from inside Qtopia due to a bug in Qtopia's virtual
terminal handling (it refuses to release the terminal), which I unfortunately
cannot work around from my code. You'll need to launch fbvnc from the text
console. Shut down qtopia and log in on the console (Zaurus: press '/' during
the countdown, then 'a' and log in as root).

<dt><b>Suspend and light control don't work</b>

<dd>On the Zaurus, the 'zapmd' daemon is required to enable these features.
As far as I know, it's not available as a standalone package, but it
is included in the X11-for-Zaurus package. The <b>chroot-debian</b>
installation also includes a preconfigured zapmd.

<h1>Known Bugs</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>The grayscale iPAQs are not supported (neither is anything else that
doesn't have a 16-bit color display) Since handling different pixel layouts
would require a fair amount of work to support, this is unlikely to change
anytime soon.</p>

<li><p>The volume control tries to run "aumix", which isn't part of the familiar
distribution. Nothing bad happens, the volume control just doesn't work if you don't have it.</p>

</ul>

<h1>Compiling the source code</h1>

    <p>Note that you don't need to do these steps if you choose to
    install the binary packages. If you want to experiment with the
    code, read on...</p>

    <p>Get the Unix source code for VNC, unpack and compile it. It is available
    from <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/"
    >http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/</a>.</p>

    <p>You also need the ofbis library, available from:
      <a href="http://osis.nocrew.org/ofbis/"
	 >http://osis.nocrew.org/ofbis/</a>.
      Set the path in fbvnc/Imakefile to match where you installed this
      library.</p>

    <p>Move the fbvnc directory into the VNC source directory:
      <pre>
      # mv fbvnc vnc_unixsrc/</pre>

    <p>Now you can build the code:
    <pre>
      # cd fbvnc
      # xmkmf
      # make</pre>

<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h2>v1.0 - 2003-01-10</h2>

<ul>

<li>Remapped buttons - "pan" and "action" buttons are now separate

<li>Automatic hardware detection - use the same binary for iPAQ and
Zaurus (manual selection: command line flag '-hw zaurus' or '-hw ipaq')

<li>Grid-based scrolling using hardware buttons (if you move and resize
windows to exactly fit the current viewport, you can easily return to the exact same spot later)

<li>Start in portrait mode by default

</ul>

<h2>v0.8 - 2002-12-25</h2>

<ul>

<li>Yes, a new release after over a year...

<li>The Sharp Zaurus is now supported - you can use the hardware keyboard and the overlay interchangeably.

<li>Touchscreen calibration support, saved in /etc/fbvnc-calibration.conf. To
redo the calibration, press the 'pan' button ('Start' on iPAQ, 'Action'
(center of cursor pad) on Zaurus) eight times.

<li>The overlay keyboard now properly shows the shift state

<li>Performance enhancements when overlays are active

<li>Bugfixes - in older versions, some pixels were not redrawn correctly in scaled modes.

<li>More keyboard shortcuts for functions, using the 'pan' button together
with other keys. This doesn't work well on the iPAQ, because it can't register simultaneous button presses.

<li>The overlay keyboard can be hidden by clicking the overlay icon (next to the mouse icon)

</ul>

<h2>v0.7 - 2001-08-24</h2>

<ul>
<li>I shouldn't make releases without having an iPAQ to test them on... the releases made Aug 22 had debugging output turned on, which slowed things down. This one fixes that but is otherwise identical to v0.6.
</ul>

<h2>v0.6 - 2001-08-22</h2>

<ul>
<li>On some iPAQs, fbvnc dies when the ofbis library is attempting to set the
palette (FBsetcmap). This release uses a patched library that doesn't try to modify
the color map. Thanks to Andreas Koenig for his help in tracking this down.
</ul>

<h2>v0.5 - 2001-08-22</h2>

<ul>
<li>Open /dev/ts, and (if that doesn't work) /dev/h3600_ts, since the distributions apparently can't decide where the touchscreen device should go...
</ul>

<h2>v0.4 - 2001-08-22</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the portrait mode scaling bug - 3:1 and 4:1 scaling should work now in portrait mode as well.
<li>Open /dev/h3600_ts instead of /dev/ts which is missing in current releases
</ul>

<h2>v0.3 - 2001-08-13</h2>

<ul>
<li>Allow quitting fbvnc with the combination Fn-Shift-Q (this was previously disabled for localhost use, but is quite useful when using fbvnc together with QPE or native X11 - quitting fbvnc switches back to the previously used desktop environment.)
<li>Map the <tt>Calendar</tt> button to the <tt>Tab</tt> key - this is useful
for filename completion when working with a Unix shell.
<li>Updated the <tt>vnc</tt> shell script so that it doesn't launch a background VNC server if one appears to be running already.
</ul>

<h2>v0.2 - 2001-07-15</h2>

<ul>
<li>transparent overlays
<li>subpixel-accuracy scaling
<li>new logic for 3-button-mouse mode
<li><i>ipkg</i>-compatible packaging
</ul>

<h2>v0.1 - 2000-10-30</h2>

<ul>
<li>Initial release
</ul>

<h1>Future plans and ideas (not yet implemented)</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Add more overlay icons, i.e. a battery power display.</p>

<li><p>If the VNC client and server are running on the same machine, a
shared memory area (written by Xvnc and read by fbvnc) could be used
to avoid duplicate bitmap storage and unnecessary overhead. The fbvnc
screen redraws are already quite fast, performance is
mostly limited by the overhead imposed by the TCP socket based VNC
protocol.</p>

<li><p>Optimize the scaled and rotated display modes further. The current
	(v0.7) performance values for local screen redraw (no
	communication with the VNC server) in frames per second are:

      </p>


<li><p>Implement virtual terminal switching, so that fbvnc could be used
concurrently with Xfbdev or QPE. Currently, exiting fbvnc returns you to the
	previously used virtual terminal. Re-run the <tt>vnc</tt>
	shell script to reconnect to the session again.</p>
