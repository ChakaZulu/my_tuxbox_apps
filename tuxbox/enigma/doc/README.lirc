Basic lirc-support:

data/lirc/ir_vcr_start.lirc and ir_vcr_stop.lirc are used for the command-sequences.
First line specifies the device to use and the following lines define the commands to send.
WAIT_A_WHILE waits for some time and does nothing.
You need lircd and a fitting lircd.conf from lircd.org or generated by irrecord.
