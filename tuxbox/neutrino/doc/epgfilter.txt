EPGFILTER - Filter out unwanted EPG entries
-------------------------------------------

If you want to filter out EPG entries from being collected inside sectionsd
(e.g. to not waste memory for services that you do not use anyway), there
is a facility to do that.
Create a file /var/tuxbox/config/zapit/epgfilter.xml (defined as
EPG_FILTER_PATH in sectionsd.cpp) with the following contents:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<epgfilter is_whitelist = "1" except_current_next = "1">
    <filter serviceID="6dca" name="Das Erste" tsid="044d" onid="0001"/>
    <filter serviceID="6d66" name="ZDF" tsid="0437" onid="0001"/>
</epgfilter>

(the "name=" property is only for better readability, it is not needed)
This example would lead to only EPG for the two channels "Das Erste" and
"ZDF" being collected.
You can also list complete transponders or providers by specifying wildcards.
Using the value "0" for serviceID, tsid or onid (or omitting the property)
will result in this value to be ignored completely. Example:
    <filter onid="0001" tsid="044d">
will filter on the whole transponder.

The is_whitelist property determines if the list is used as a whitelist (1)
(listing all the channels for which EPG is collected) or as a blacklist (0)
(listing all the channels for which no EPG is collected).

The except_current_next property determines if the current and next events
should also be subject to the EPG filtering. In the above example, current
and next events would be collected on all channels. If this is set to 0, no
current and next events are collected on channels that are filtered.

The default is "is_whitelist = 1" and "except_current_next = 1".

Note that the above filters are only affecting the storage of the events:
all events are still read and processed, but they are not stored, so this
leads to memory savings.

BLACKLISTING specific channels:
-------------------------------
Due to driver problems, some boxes hang up on certain channels when EPG
collection is enabled. As a quick workaround, the blacklist feature was
hacked into sectionsd.
It gets activated by adding 'blacklist="1"' to a filter entry.
Note that in this case, no EPG filter is added, but sectionsd is instructed
to sleep almost completely when switching to this channel. There might still
be events received for this channel on other transponders.

Example:
    <filter serviceID="445d" name="ProSieben" tsid="0453" onid="0001" blacklist="1"/>

This would make sectionsd sleep whenever the box is zapped to "ProSieben".
In order to blacklist a whole transponder, something like that would be used:

    <filter tsid="0421" onid="0001" blacklist="1"/>

This would blacklist the whole 10.83225GHz transponder on Astra 19.2E.
