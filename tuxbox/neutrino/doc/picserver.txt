INTRO
======
The neutrino picserver is an external program that helps neutrino decode
digital pictures (JPEGs only at the moment). 
This decreases the time it takes for a compressed picture to be displays
in neutrino (usually 7-8 sec for a jpeg, with picserver between 3 to 4 sec). 
To achieve this , the pictures are not decoded on the dbox but on an
external server. Neutrino just sends a request to the server, the
server decodes the compressed image and sends it back uncompressed to 
neutrino.

There is a sample picserver program for unix servers in the tuxbox cvs.
(hostapps/neutrino_picserver/)
Should run with cygwin on win32 servers also.
Native ports to othe rplatforms are welcome. The protocol used is very
simple (see unix picserver.c). In case of questions feel free to ask...

Notes: 
- Neutrino does not send the data of the compressed picture (e.g. jpeg) to
  the server, since this would take too much time (slow network) and would
  eat up almost all speed increase. There for only 
  the path of the pic is sent. This means the picture
  needs to be accesible by the server somehow. The fastest
  solution is to run the picserver prog on the machine
  that hosts the pictures. 
  Since pathnames are not identical on client (mounted filesys)
  and server (local filesys). The server needs to do some mapping.
  (e.g. convert /mnt/photos/pic1.jpg -> /data/photos/pic1.jpg)
- The server sends the pic to neutrino in 16 bit resultion (RGB555)
  This decreases the amount of data that need to be transferred to the 
  box via network by 33% and results in a overall speed increase.
  The neutrino picviewer on the dbox2 does not display the pic with
  more colors anyway...
- Picviewer works with jpeg only at the moment...
- If the picserver is not reachable or the picture cannot be decoded by the
  server for whatever reason, the picture is decoded locally.

Limitations (at the moment)
- Only one picserver can be defined
- If picserver is enabled, all JPEG are tried to be decoded via this 
  server. 

Configuration
==============
- Enter ip and port of decode server in neutrino picviwer settings.
- Start picserver programm on server (use same port)
  e.g. picserver -d -r "/mnt/photos,/data/src/pix" 9999
