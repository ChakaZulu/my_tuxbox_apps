FBtest
------

Tries to set all possible modes on GTX/eNX and returns information which 
modes are supported on the current device.
Not all modes are supported on a GTX.

For testing a simple 4-field colour image is drawn. 
This should fill the whole screen, should be centered and should 
look pretty much the same in all cases. Note that the fourth colour
is "white" but set to full transparency, so this will look different.

Entering just "fbtest" will cycle through all modes

There are 3 options:
-f : select one of the pixelformats (CLUT4,CLUT8,ARGB1555,ARGB)
	(RGB565 is also included but seems not to work, at least not on
	my machine, more testing is necessary for this one...)
-s : select one of the 16 FB-sizes. All combinations of
	width: 320,360,640,720
	height: 240,288,480,576
     are possible (but take heed of graphics RAM limits)
-n : inhibits clearing the framebuffer after each mode. This way you can
    retain the image

Example: "fbtest -s720x576 -fCLUT8 -n"
