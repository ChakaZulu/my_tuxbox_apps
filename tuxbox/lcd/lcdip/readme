lcdip:
------

function: allows to enter an IP address in dotted decimal notation through the LCD 
	  by either entering it via remote control or the 3 frontpanel buttons

input:	via remote control: 
		press key number (0-9) to directly enter a number
		press UP/DOWN to get the next higher/lower digit
		press LEFT/RIGHT to skip to previous/next position
		press OK to save and exit the app (number is checked for correctness).
			In case of an error, press OK to correct the number.
	
	via frontpanel buttons:
		press UP/DOWN to set number
		press STANDBY to skip to next position or save and exit the app if
			last number has been reached. In case of an error, press
			STANDBY again to correct the number.
	
output: writes the IP to /var/lcdip.conf as a human readable ASCII-string
	
return values: 0 on success, other value on error

remark: Originally this app set the ip through "ipconfig" which is no longer present. 
	Anyway, I think it's better to use this as part of a (startup) script if needed. 
	That's why I also replaced the original binary lcdip.conf with ASCII, so it can be
	read in easier by a shell script.
	
	Feel free to enhance!
