fbshot is a simple utility to grab images of the framebuffer, than 
it saves them to a .png file. actually it supports 8,15,16,24 and 32-bit
depth's. it can grab any size of the screen.

actualy i'm working at 16-bit planar VGA support.
this utility was writen on the x86 hardware, ad so it supports typical pc 
cards, if you are using any other hw, and succseed or not in using this 
tool than please e-mail me

as soon as i get my hands on any different hw i'm going to make suitable 
changes
