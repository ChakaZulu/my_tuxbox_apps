	 <H1>dvbsnoop - A DVB Stream Analyzer Tool</H1> 
	 <H2>What is dvbsnoop?</H2>
	 <P>dvbsnoop is a DVB sniffer and monitoring program. <BR><BR>Its purpose is
		to debug, dump or view dvb/mpeg/dsm-cc/MHP stream information (e.g. digital
		television broadcasts) send via satellite, cable or terrestrial. Basically you
		can describe dvbsnoop as a simple DVB/MPEG stream analyzer, similar to TCP
		network sniffer programs like <I>snoop</I> on Sun Solaris or <I>tcpdump</I>
		under Linux.<BR><BR> The programm was mainly written to learn and understand
		the DVB protocol structures and streams sent via sattelites. Out of this
		reason, the programm ist not performance optimized, but it will hopefully do
		its job.</P>
	 <H2>Under what Licence is dvbsnoop?</H2>
