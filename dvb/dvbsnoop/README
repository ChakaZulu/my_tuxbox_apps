========


dvbsnoop is a DVB sniffer and monitor program to debug, dump
or view dvb/mpeg/dsm-cc/MHP stream information (digital
television) send via satellite, cable or terrestrial.
Basically dvbsnoop is a simple DVB stream analyzer.


The programm was mainly written to learn and understand the DVB 
protocol structures and streams. This program is not performance
optimized, but was itself part of the learning process... ;-)



Important:
  This program may not be used to hack pay tv or encrypted dvb services
  in any way.
