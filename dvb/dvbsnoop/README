dvbsnoop

a dvb sniffer tool, to trace network traffic on DVB-S (Satellite),
DVB-C (Cable) & DVB-T (Terrestric) broadcast networks.


The programm was mainly written to learn and understand the dvb
protocol structures and streams. This program is not performance
optimized, but was itself part of the learning process... ;-)



Important:
  This program may not be used to hack pay tv or encrypted dvb services
  in any way.
