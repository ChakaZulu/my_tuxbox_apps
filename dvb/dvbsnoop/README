dvbsnoop

a DVB sniffer tool, to trace network traffic on DVB-S (Satellite),
DVB-C (Cable) & DVB-T (Terrestric) digital TV broadcast networks.


The programm was mainly written to learn and understand the DVB 
protocol structures and streams. This program is not performance
optimized, but was itself part of the learning process... ;-)
