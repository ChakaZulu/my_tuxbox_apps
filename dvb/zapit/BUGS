zapit's list of known bugs
--------------------------

There are lots of bugs in zapit, and I don't know and don't remember all of
them. So this list is not complete and will never be. However, if someone
wants to improve zapit and does not know where to start, this list might be
an entry point.

- Incorrect section filtering:

  DVB Tables like PAT, PMT are broadcasted as so called sections which are
  usually limited to 1024 bytes size. Therefore large tables are split into
  multiple parts. Each part is called a section. When reading a table, filters
  are set up to read all sections, one by one, starting at section 0, ending
  at section n, where n is the last_section_number, which is present in every
  section header of sections with section_syntax_indicator = 1. This is a bug,
  because filter timeouts will occur, even if data would be available. The
  filtering scheme must be changed, so that zapit does not filter by
  section_number, but keeps a list of already received sections, which is
  expanded until no more new sections are received for a given timeout. This
  bug applies to every file in src/zapsi.

Have fun,
